Overview: This data set uses apis to collected weather for over 500 cities. All visualizations are contained in the output data  folder. Both ipynb files are located in the main branch. The goal was to visualize and find the relationship for cities latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed. Resources I used to help me write code are Instructor Drew's speed runs and recorded class sessions. I also used W3Schools Matplotlib Tutorial as a reference to write the code and for better understanding.
